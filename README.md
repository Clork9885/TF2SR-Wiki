# TF2SR Wiki

This is the source for the modular wiki project for Titanfall 2 Speedrunning
The actual wiki can be found on (there will be a URL here later i think in my opinion)

## Want to contribute?

This wiki runs on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to work.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node (ideally v18.16 but v16 or above should work too i think)
3. Install all the necessary packages by running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in your local repo
4. Then run `npm run docusaurus start` to run the site locally (it automatically updates whenever you save your changes)
5. Make your epic and awesome and swag changes or additions
6. Make an epic and awesome and swag pull request
