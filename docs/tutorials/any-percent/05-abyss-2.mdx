# üêå Abyss 2

Sadly, this level is mostly a huge autoscroller due to the slow cycle of the platforms you have to ride to the dome. Despite this, there are still routes in this level used for bypassing the hazardous parts of the assembly line, and a choice of skips towards the end.

:::tip 
Deaths in this level will only lose time if you **don't** get a quickdeath, meaning you are safe to fall down in most areas at the very start.
:::

## Intro

Your intro movement doesn't matter until you have passed the section with the platforms heading into the grinder. There are a number of swag strats, but for the most safety:

- Grab the box to your right at the very start to easily make it to the platform with the grunts.
- If needed, pick up any frags or a spitfire from the set of 3 grunts after falling down the vent.
- Once reaching the set of moving platforms for the first time, wait for the platform to turn on its side and wallrun while it moves forward. This part of its animation is the safest to use as it gives a much more controllable amount of platform velocity.
- Use the small rails to either side of the grinder and the wall on the right to avoid it without the use of the platform.


## Toldspice Route

This route again doesn't save any time, but is primarily used for safety. It allows you to bypass the danger of the assembly line and also provides a very large time cushion that you can use to clear the final area of any enemies that may intefere with your platform ride setups.

On entering the area after the grinder, use the right-most square pillar and the wall next to it to get as much height as possible and walljump over to the large outcrop of rocks. This outcrop runs all the way from here to the final platform area, so you can use any movement you want to climb forward along the rocks. 
Once you reach the large grey box, you will have to make a semi-precise jump from the wall of the box followed by a strafe to the right to land on the last section of the rock outcrop - it is safest to go slower here so you can mantle on the rocks rather than trying to land directly on them. From this set of rocks you can usually make it to the final area with a simple slide jump or wallrun, and a strafe to the right.

After reaching the final area, it's safest to clear it of enemies using the time you gained on the platforms.


## Platform Ride

:::diffm

### Dome Launch
This strat uses the brief upward movement of the platform once it reaches the assembly area to launch up to the balconly without having to do any climbing.

Line up with the small blue part of the platform like this: [image]

After the long wait for the platform to reach the assembly area, you will need to jump and then hold backwards at the right time in the platform's upwards animation in order to reach the top of the balcolny cleanly.
The feel for the timing will mostly come from practice, but some runners use cues such as the small "square" in the corner leaving their FOV or a visual cue on the geometry to the left. - it's best to experiment with finding the timing and use what works best for you.

A helpful guide for this is the type of velocity you get on each attempt: if you go too far forward / too low, your jump was too early, and if you go too far straight up, you jumped too late. 

If you get the correct launch, you may also need to hold back, aiming to reach the top directly. Alternatively, you can run into the bottom of the upper-most section of cables on the wall below, which will bump you up to the top of the balcolny faster.

### Railgun
<YouTube youTubeId="ygx51yfHxbE" />

Railgun is probably one of the hardest strats in the game right now. It's effectively two strats one after the other that are both very difficult in different ways. Would only really recommend going for if your goal time is **1:18:XX** or below.

:::tip backups

These can apply to both a missed dome launch and mistakes on your railgun climb.

In dome launch, it is possible to grab the next platform that moves towards the dome if you are quick enough - while this is dangerous as getting stuck behind it will kill you, the top of it is high enough to jump off and directly onto the balcolny.

Otherwise, you can instead climb up the corner of the dome assembly where the series of stacked blue squares are found. To make this faster, you can utilize the multiple sides of all the available walls here to try and get the fastest possible series of wallgrabs. Also keep in mind that the lines of cables below the balcolny becomes grabbable in the last section, making the final stretch of the climb much easier.

## Ending

After reaching the balcolny, stand on any of the platforms below (ideally one that gets sent up decently early) and ride it to the dome.

### Dome Skip
This skip is highly recommended for runners at every level, as it is one of the major sequence breaks (~5 mins) that is very easy to perform once learned.

Inside the dome, go to this part of the wall [image], which will be on your right relative to the balcolny. Since it has missing collision, you can break out of bounds here easily by crouching and simply walking through the wall.

Once out of bounds, run along the outside of the dome with any movement as long as you reach the geometry seen here [image?] by the time the dome assembly finishes. Line up so that your crosshair is in the centre of the horizontal line of the floor below you. From here you can simply wait out the rest of the sequence, and upon the blackout you will automatically fall into the end level trigger and skip the entire dome fight.

While it is extremely easy, **this skip is still very important to make sure you fully understand** as an incorrect lineup on the fade to black can softlock you.
