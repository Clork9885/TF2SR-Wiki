# üêå Abyss 2

Sadly, this level is mostly a **huge autoscroller** due to the slow cycle of the platforms you have to ride to the dome. Despite this, there are still routes in this level used for bypassing the hazardous parts of the assembly line, and a choice of skips towards the end.

:::info 
Deaths in this level will only lose time if you **don't** get a quickdeath, meaning you are safe to fall down in most areas at the very start.

## Intro

:::diffe

Your intro movement doesn't matter until you have passed the section with the platforms heading into the grinder. Use basic movement here to be on the safe side.

- If needed, pick up any frags or a spitfire from the set of 3 grunts after falling down the vent.
- There is a number of swag strats in this section but I'd recommend not to do them because they can cause a lot of unecessary timeloss. -mats

## Toldspice Route

:::diffe

This route again doesn't save any time, but is primarily used for safety. It allows you to bypass the danger of the assembly line and also provides a very large time cushion that you can use to clear the final area of any enemies that may interfere with your platform ride setups.

After reaching the final area, it's safest to clear it of enemies while waiting for the platforms to catch up with you. 


## Platform Ride

:::diffm

### Dome Launch
This strat uses the brief upward movement of the platform once it reaches the assembly area to launch up to the balconly without having to do any climbing.

Line up with the small blue part of the platform like this: [image]

After the long wait for the platform to reach the assembly area, you will need to jump and then hold backwards at the right time in the platform's upwards animation in order to reach the top of the balcony cleanly.
The feel for the timing will mostly come from practice, but some runners use cues such as the small "square" in the corner leaving their FOV or a visual cue on the geometry to the left. - it's best to experiment with finding the timing and use what works best for you.

A helpful guide for this is the type of velocity you get on each attempt: if you go too far forward / too low, your jump was too early, and if you go too far straight up, you jumped too late. 

If you get the correct launch, you may also need to hold back, aiming to reach the top directly. Alternatively, you can run into the bottom of the upper-most section of cables on the wall below, which will bump you up to the top of the balcony faster.


**[Dome Launch needs work and a video tutorial imo -mats]**

### Railgun
<YouTube youTubeId="ygx51yfHxbE" />

Railgun is probably one of the hardest strats in the game right now. It's effectively two strats one after the other that are both very difficult in different ways. Would only really recommend going for if your goal time is **1:18:XX** or below.

:::tip backups

These can apply to both a missed dome launch and mistakes on your railgun climb.

In dome launch, it is possible to grab the next platform that moves towards the dome if you are quick enough - while this is dangerous as getting stuck behind it will kill you, the top of it is high enough to jump off and directly onto the balcony.

Otherwise, you can instead climb up the corner of the dome assembly where the series of stacked blue squares are found. To make this faster, you can utilize the multiple sides of all the available walls here to try and get the fastest possible series of wallgrabs. Also keep in mind that the lines of cables below the balcony becomes grabbable in the last section, making the final stretch of the climb much easier.

## Ending


:::diffe

### Dome Skip
This skip is highly recommended for runners at every level, as it is one of the major sequence breaks (~3.5 mins) that is very easy to perform once learned.

While it is extremely easy, **this skip is still very important to make sure you fully understand** as an incorrect lineup on the fade to black can softlock you.
