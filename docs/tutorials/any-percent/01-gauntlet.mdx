Sometimes there will also be a comment from one or more authors if there is anything worth knowing. Usually this'll be an estimate for when a particularly hard strat is worth going for.

**These are just gut feelings though!** Don't be discouraged from trying out a strat if the author says "it's only worth it for a 1:18 goal time" and you're aiming for a 1:19.
