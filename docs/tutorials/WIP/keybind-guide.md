# Keybind guide (WIP)

There's no one optimal setup for keybinds as each players hands are different shapes and sizes, so finding binds that work for you will take some experimentation. Take the following advice with a grain of salt, these are not absolutes. **The best binds are ones that feel good for you.**

## Minimum recommended changes:

**Grenade / Ordinance:** Holding Q while switching strafe directions or pressing forward is usually very uncomfortable to hold. Common options for grenade binds are mouse side buttons, middle mouse button, a key reachable on your left thumb like space. The reasoning for this change is to be able to strafe at all times without discomfort / awkwardness.

**Use hold crouch instead of toggle:** Basic slide hopping requires re-toggling crouch after every hop since the jump uncrouches you automatically. Technically doable, but much more tedious over thousands of slide hops throughout the game.

## Movement keys

WASD vs. WERD

## Optimizing for Crouch tech

Performing crouch tech becomes much easier when you make some accommodations in your binds. The default binds of `Ctrl - Crouch` and `Space - Jump` and leave a lot of room for error since the inputs are on seperate fingers and very far apart from one another.
There's two main ways to make crouch tech easier for yourself in terms of binds:

1. Make crouch and jump inputs pressable on one finger
2. Use two fingers for buttons that are close to each other

side note: 2 seperate crouch binds, one for crouch tech and another for slide hopping

## Keybinds for menuing

### Using AHK
